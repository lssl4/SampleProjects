<A NAME="intro"><h3>Introduction</h3></A>

Here are two quotations from books by famous authors.

<p><i>
Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home
and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of
existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very
little to distress or vex her.  She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate,
indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister's marriage, been
mistress of his house from a very early period. Her mother had died
too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of
her caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as
governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.
</i></p>

<p><i>
Alice never could quite make out, in thinking it over afterwards, how it
was that they began: all she remembers is, that they were running hand
in hand, and the Queen went so fast that it was all she could do to keep
up with her: and still the Queen kept crying 'Faster! Faster!' but Alice
felt she COULD NOT go faster, though she had not breath left to say so.
The most curious part of the thing was, that the trees and the other
things round them never changed their places at all: however fast they
went, they never seemed to pass anything. 'I wonder if all the things
move along with us?' thought poor puzzled Alice. And the Queen seemed to
guess her thoughts, for she cried, 'Faster! Don't try to talk!'

<p>In this assignment, your task will be to write a computer program that can (usually) predict whether quotations
such as these are more likely to have been written by one author or another. There are many reasonable approaches to this problem. In this assignment, we will consider one of these: We will begin by building a statistical model of the kind of language used by each author. Then, given a new piece of text, we will determine who wrote it by measuring how well it fits each of the statistical models, and selecting the one that gives the best fit.

<p>The project is intended to extend your understanding of Java programming, your knowledge of the
Java libraries and  to introduce one of the machine learning techniques used by researchers.

You should spend at least one hour reading through this handout to make sure you understand what is required, so that you don't waste your time going in circles, or worse yet, hand in something you think is correct and find out later that you misunderstood the specifications. Highlight the handout, scribble on it, and find all the things you're not sure about as soon as possible.  Any questions should be 
posted to help1001, so
that the answers can be shared by all students.


<p><b>Markov models.</b>&nbsp;
The probabilistic language models we will be using are called
<i>Markov models</i>.
Markov models are at the heart of modern speech
recognition systems, and are used for a broad range of natural language
processing tasks, as well as many other problems relevant to artificial intelligence.
They are widely used to model
all sorts of dynamical processes in engineering, mathematics, finance and many
other areas.

<p>
A Markov model defines a probability distribution over sequences of symbols.
Said differently, a Markov model defines a probabilistic mechanism for randomly
generating sequences over some alphabet of symbols.
In a <i>zero-th order Markov model</i>, the symbols in the sequence are generated
with a fixed probability that does not in any way depend on other symbols in the sequence.
For instance, the alphabet might consist of just the letters <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt>,
and the zero-th
order Markov model might specify that each symbol in the sequence is <tt>a</tt> with
probability 2/3 and <tt>b</tt> with probability 1/3.&nbsp; Thus, such a zero-th order Markov
model might generate a sequence like the following:

<blockquote>
<tt>a b a b a a a b b b a a a a b b b a a b a a a a a b a a a a b a a a b b</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
In a <i>first order Markov model</i>, the probability of the current symbol that is
being generated can depend on preceding symbol.&nbsp; For instance, consider a
sequence in which every occurrence of <tt>b</tt> is always followed by <tt>a</tt>, while an a is followed
with equal probability by either <tt>a</tt> or <tt>b</tt>.&nbsp; For instance, such a model might
generate a sequence like the following.

<blockquote>
<tt>b a b a b a b a a b a b a b a b a a b a a b a a a a a a b a b a a a a b</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
In this example, the sequence is likely to have about the same proportion of <tt>a</tt>'s
and <tt>b</tt>'s as in the preceding example. However, the model is first order
rather than zero-th order because whether or not the current symbol is <tt>a</tt> or
<tt>b</tt>
significantly affects the probability of what symbol will be generated next.<p>
This idea can be generalized to a <i>k-th order Markov model</i> in which the
probability of the current symbol can depend on the preceding <i>k</i> symbols.<p>
Markov models are frequently used to build a probabilistic model or statistical
estimate of a natural language.&nbsp; In modeling ordinary English text, a zero-th
order model is clearly inadequate for most purposes, capturing only the
frequencies of each letter.
On the other hand, a first order Markov model
can capture the notion, for instance, that a <tt>q</tt> is nearly always
followed by <tt>u</tt>.
Higher order Markov models can capture the tendency of the letters
<tt>proba</tt> to be followed by <tt>b</tt> or <tt>t</tt>.
(In other language applications, entire
words are regarded as the "letters"
of the "alphabet" so that the Markov model
provides a model of the sequences of <i>words</i> rather than <i>letters</i>
that are likely to be observed.
We will not consider such a framework in
this assignment, but you are welcome to explore it on your own.)

<p><b>Creating NGrams</b>
The first part of the assignment is to implement
a class called <tt>NGramModel.java</tt> that constructs
a dictionary of n-grams for a given n and input string.
This class should provide methods to construct an n-gram and
also getter methods to return the size of the alphabet and the total
number of n-gram words counted for this model.

<p>Method signatures to be implemented are in <code>NGramModel.java</code> and
JUnit test cases for this class are provided in <code>testNGramModel.java</code>.


<p><b>Creating a Markov Model</b>
The next part of the assignment is to build
a <i>k</i>-th order Markov model from an input string (and eventually from
text stored in a given file).
Later you will build an object of this class for each author of interest.
Constructing a <i>k</i>-th order Markov model
from text sequences is mostly a matter of counting.
For each sequence <i>p</i> of
length <i>k</i> (let us call it the <i>context</i>), we need to estimate the probability
of <i>p</i> being followed by each letter <i>c</i> in our alphabet.
Given a text sample, this probability can be estimated by the number of times that <i>p</i> is
followed by <i>c</i>, divided by the number of times that <i>p</i> appears as a
context at all.
That is, we can estimate the probability of <i>c</i> following <i>p</i>
by <i>N</i>(<i>p&middot;c</i>) / <i>N</i>(<i>p</i>), where
<i>N</i>(<i>p&middot;c</i>) denotes the number of times we observe the concatenated
sequence <i>p&middot;c</i>, and <i>N</i>(<i>p</i>) denotes the number of times that
we observe <i>p</i>.

<p>
Unfortunately, this estimate will be problematic if
some of the counts are zero, as is certain to happen on real data.
Therefore, instead, we will use a different &quot;smoothed&quot; estimate, namely
(<i>N</i>(<i>p&middot;c</i>) + 1) / (<i>N</i>(<i>p</i>) + <i>S</i>),
where <i>S</i> is the size of our alphabet.
This form of smoothing,
called <i>Laplace smoothing</i>, has theoretical justification coming from probability
theory, and ensures that zero counts will not be a problem.

<p>
For example, if the input text is
<tt>"aabcabaacaac"</tt>, and we
are using a second-order Markov model (<i>k</i> = 2) and the three-letter alphabet
is <tt>{a, b, c}</tt>,
then we can estimate the probability that <tt>"aa"</tt> is
followed by <tt>'c'</tt>; by (2 + 1) / (3 + 3) = 1/2 since
<i>N</i>(<tt>aa</tt>) = 3, <i>N</i>(<tt>aac</tt>) = 2 and <i>S</i> = 3.
Similarly, the probabilities that <tt>"aa"</tt> is followed by
<tt>'a'</tt> and <tt>'b'</tt> is 1/6 and 1/3, respectively.
<!-- Note that the probabilities sum to 1. No they do not -->

<p>
One thing to notice here: To handle the beginning and end of the string, we
treat the string as circular. Thus, <i>N</i>(<tt>caa</tt>) = 2 instead of 1.


<p>
So, in constructing a Markov model, your first job is to write code that will
compute the appropriate counts <i>N</i>(&middot;) by scanning the text
file and counting how many times all sequences
of the required lengths appear in the file.
These counts should be stored appropriately for later use.
You should also compute and record the alphabet size.
Organize your program by creating a class
<tt>MarkovModel</tt> so that the
first line below computes the number of occurrences
of each substring from s of size k and k+1; the second
line prints it to standard output; and remaining lines
compute and print Laplace smoothed probability
estimates.

<blockquote><pre>
MarkovModel model = new MarkovModel(k, s);
System.out.print(model.toString());
System.out.printf("%.4f\n", model.laplace("aac"));
System.out.printf("%.4f\n", model.laplace("aaa"));
System.out.printf("%.4f\n", model.laplace("aab"));
</pre></blockquote>

For example, when k = 2 and s = <tt>"aabcabaacaac"</tt>,
this code fragment should print the following.


<blockquote><pre>
ca 3
ba 1
ac 2
aa 3
ab 2
bc 1
Alphabet size = 3
Number of words = 12
aba 1
aab 1
aac 2
cab 1
abc 1
caa 2
bca 1
baa 1
aca 2
Alphabet size = 3
Number of words = 12
0.5000
0.1667
0.3333
</pre></blockquote>




<p><b>Determining the likelihood of a new sequence.</b>

Next you will write a class <tt>BestModel.java</tt> for employing Markov models to 
test texts.

We will want to use the Markov model that you constructed from data
to compute a measure of how
well that model fits a new text sequence.
We will also use this measure
to determine which of two models better fits a
new test String.
To compute a measure of fit, we will compute the
probability of the model generating the new sequence, a quantity usually called
the <i>likelihood</i> of the sequence under the model. 
For each symbol <i>c</i>
in the sequence, we can compute the probability of observing <i>c</i> under the model,
given its <i>k</i>-letter context <i>p</i>.
In particular, this is just the Laplace-smoothed
estimate given above.
To compute the likelihood, or probability of the
entire sequence, we can multiply these probabilities together,
for all symbols in the sequence. Although correct mathematically,
the resulting product might be indistinguishable from zero using
floating point arithmetic.
Therefore, rather than
multiplying probabilities, you will need to work with <i>log</i> probabilities.&nbsp;
That is, for each symbol <i>c</i> in the sequence, you will need to compute the
<i>log</i> of
its probability, and you will then <i>add</i> (rather than multiply) these log
probabilities to arrive at the final log likelihood of the sequence.
Keep in mind that all of these log probabilities will be negative (since
probabilities are never more than one).

<p>
The next task is to compute, for a given string, and for each position <i>i</i> in
the string, an estimate of the log probability of the character at position <i>i</i>,
given its <i>k</i>-character context. The log likelihood of this entire sequence
can then be computed as the sum of these log probabilities.

<p>
For instance, continuing the example above, having constructed the second order
(<i>k</i> = 2) Markov model,
suppose we are given a new string <tt>"aabca"</tt>. We can compute the log
probability of each of the four symbols in this string as follows (where the
first column gives the context of each of the symbols in the second column):

<blockquote>
<pre>
context c log probability
------------------------------------------------
"aa" 'b' log((1 + 1) / (3 + 3)) = -1.0986
"ab" 'c' log((1 + 1) / (2 + 3)) = -0.9163
"bc" 'a' log((1 + 1) / (1 + 3)) = -0.6931
"ca" 'a' log((2 + 1) / (3 + 3)) = -0.6931
"aa" 'a' log((0 + 1) / (3 + 3)) = -1.7918

TOTAL log likelihood = -5.1930
AVERAGE log likelihood = -1.0386
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
One thing to notice here: To handle the beginning and end of the string, we
again treat the string as circular. Thus, in <tt>"aabca"</tt>,
the character following the context <tt>"ca"</tt> is <tt>'a'</tt>.


<p><b>Choosing the best model.</b>
Now that we have a method of measuring the
fit of a model to a particular string, we can choose the best model to be the
one that maximizes the likelihood of the string. In other words, we can
simply measure the likelihood of the string under each model
and choose the one that is greatest.

Write a class <code>BestModel</code> with constructor,
<p>
<code>public BestModel(int k, String text1, String text2, String test)</code>

that takes an order parameter k, two input strings for training and a test string as its input.
Your program should read the test sequence
and decide whether it is more likely to come from the Markov model of
text1 or text2.
Having calculated the necessary models,
the class offers a number of methods for choosing the best match, and the confidence of that match.

<p>
To get an idea of why the algorithm is making its predictions, you should also
find and print the top positions in the test sequence where the difference in
the log probabilities of the two models are greatest by implementing the method:
<code>explainBestModel</code>.  See the comments and tests for details.



<A NAME="implementation"><h3>Possible Staged Implementation</h3></A>

This project is much larger than project 1, so you will need a good strategy for 
tackling it. Here are some suggestions.



<p>First, read this handout thoroughly and carefully, making sure you understand everything in it, particularly the different linguistic features.
Read the given BlueJ project skeletons to get an overview of what you will be writing. It is not necessary at this point to understand every detail of the
provided code in order to make progress on this project.

<p>The project has been broken down into suggested separate stages
to help you create the finished version in small steps. You
are recommended to compile, test and run the application after 
each stage to check that the changes you have made are correct.
To avoid getting overwhelmed, deal with one class at a time,
and develop one method a time. Start with methods that don't call any other methods; this will allow you to test them right away.   At each stage use the provided JUnit test classes to check your code.
Also use the <code>Demo</code> methods to check your implementation.

<p>You can gain good marks even if you do not complete all the
methods, so long as the code you have written compiles and runs
correctly.  But if you submit a large body of code that does 
not compile or that crashes, then few marks can be awarded. 


<A NAME="challenge"><h3>Challenge Tasks (optional)</h3></A>

Completing all the steps (above) is worth up to 80% of the total 
marks for the project.
If you have time and wish to extend your knowledge of Java, then
you are encouraged to extend your project to take it
further towards a complete application. <b>Up to 20%</b> will be
awarded for the completion and demonstration of challenge tasks.
There are only a few project marks to be awarded for the 
Challenge tasks (relative to the effort required): 
this part of the project is primarily intended for interest and fun.

<p>It is up to you to identify, select and complete additional 
functionality in your challenge code.
You must submit a TEXT file called <code>Challenge.txt</code>.
This file should give a brief summary 
of your challenge code: what you have implemented and how it works.
Make sure that your file uses exactly the name Challenge.txt, or
your challenge activities may not be noted, and so may receive no marks. 

Some possible additions could be to  apply your programs to other
related tasks (for instance, distinguishing two authors, distinguishing German
text from English, etc.) or by comparing different sampling methods (Good-Turing, assuming a Dirichlet prior, or Jeffreys-Perks).
Submit any data files that you create (or, if
they are too big for cssubmit, tell us how we can get them).
Write a description of how well it performs.

Analyze your approach to this problem giving estimates of
its time and space requirements. Also, critically explore the
effectiveness of this technique for this task.


<A NAME="submissiondemo"><h3>Submission and Demonstration</h3></A>

In accordance with School policy, a <b>penalty of 20% 
of the total project marks (that is, 10 marks) per day or part thereof</b>
will be applied
to late submissions.  You are responsible for ensuring that your project is
uploaded to cssubmit before the deadline published on the cssubmit area.

Submit the following files to 
<a href="https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/cssubmit?p=np&open=CITS1001-1">cssubmit</a>

<ol>
<li>NgramModel.java
<li>MarkovModel.java
<li>BestModel.java

<p>If you have completed any challenge tasks, then also submit

<li>The .java files for any additional classes you have implemented 
or modified
<li>A TEXT file called <code>Challenge.txt</code> giving a brief summary of your
challenge code: what you have implemented and how it works.
</ol>

<p><b>Do not submit zip files or any text files you used for testing.</b>  You can show these at your demonstration.  You are responsible for checking the messages given by the submission system and ensuring that your submission is in the correct format and with correct Java signatures.

<p>You do not need to submit the Demo class, the TextFileManager or the JUnit test classes.
Your submission will be marked using the versions of these classes provided with the 
downloaded project.
Remember that, as in the first project, you must not change any of the given signatures
in the project files.  But you are welcome to add new methods if you need them.
You are responsible for checking that your submission 
compiles with the test files provided in the project source, and 
that your code passes as many of
the test cases as you are able to complete.


<p>In accordance with the departmental policy on plagiarism, 
all submitted lab work is expected to be the sole effort of the 
student submitting the work.
All submissions will be checked for similarity and the
consequences for misconduct can be severe, 
including being awarded 0 marks for assessment or
exclusion from the unit.

<p><b>Project demonstrations (15 minutes) will be held during 
normal lab times in WEEK 13.  You are responsible for
contacting your lab tutor to book a demonstration session 
BEFORE THE PROJECT SUBMISSION DEADLINE</b>.
During the demonstration you will be asked to 
run your project,
answer questions about your code, 
and make modifications to your code.
Students who miss their demonstration will be awarded 0 marks
for this part of the assessment.  

<p>
If you have extenuating circumstances which prevent you
meeting the project requirements, these circumstances
must be reported through the student affairs staff of your Faculty
as soon as is practical.


<A NAME="assessment"><h3>Assessment Criteria</h3></A>

This project will be marked out of 50 using the following criteria:

<h4>Correctness (/20) </h4>

(Have all methods in  the project classes been implemented? 
Do they work as specified by the provided JUnit tests
and the Demo class?)
