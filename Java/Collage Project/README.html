<h1>CITS1001 project 1 2014</h1>

<i>This page is a copy of the README.txt file in the project package.</i>



<h3>Purpose of the project</h3>

<p>The project is intended to extend your understanding of object
collections, and give you experience in completing and demonstrating
a complete Java application. 
The project can be tackled after completing the CITS1001 lectures 
and labs for weeks 1 to 5, covering material up to 
Section 4.6 of Chapter 4 of 
<br>
   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ<br>
   Fifth edition<br>
   David J. Barnes and Michael Kolling<br>
   Pearson Education, 2012

<h3>The task</h3>

<p>A collage is a piece of art made by sticking various different materials such as photographs and pieces of paper or fabric onto a backing.
In this project you will write Java code for making collages out of images stored on a computer.

<p>Your task for this project is to complete the outline
implementation of the Collage class,
and to implement a new class, MyDemo, 
to illustrate the functionality of your project.
Optionally, students 
who have extra time and wish to extend their programming skills
are encouraged to identify and implement some challenge tasks for the project.

<p>The project application
comprises 6 classes: Fragment, Collage, ImageManager, CollageTest, Canvas and SampleDemo.
A collage is modelled in Java as a collection (ArrayList) of image Fragment objects.  
A complete version of all the necessary classes (except Collage and MyDemo) are already provided 
for you in this project, and they should not need any modification.  

<p>The first task is to complete the Collage class.  
An outline (walking skeleton) of this class has been provided 
in this BlueJ project.  Implement code for each method
using information given in the Javadoc comments of the
source file, and confirmed by the JUnit test
class, CollageTest, that is also provided.

<p>The second task is to develop your own MyDemo class
to illustrate the functionality of your project.    This class is intended to
be shown to a customer.  It should illustrate that each of your
Collage methods works correctly.
The provided SampleDemo class gives some ideas about how you could do this.

      
 

    
<h3>Possible Staged Implementation</h3>


The project has been broken down into suggested separate stages
to help you create the finished version in small steps. You
are recommended to compile, test and run the application after 
each stage to check that the changes you have made are correct.

You can gain good marks even if you do not complete all the
methods, so long as the code you have written compiles and runs
correctly.  But if you submit a large body of code that does 
not compile or that crashes, then few marks can be awarded. 

<ol>
<li> <b>Read the code and its documentation for each class in the BlueJ project</b>
to familiarise yourself with the methods offered.
When you open each class, toggle between the Source Code and 
Documentation views (the top right hand of the window) to see
a summary of the services offered by each class.

<li> <b>Implement the required methods in the Collage class
one by one</b>.  Test your code after each new method is added
using the Junit tests in CollageTest and by running the SampleDemo provided.

<li> <b>Create your own MyDemo class</b>  and write code
so that running your demonstration clearly illustrates the capabilities
of your Collage class.
The provided SampleDemo class can be used for ideas.
Use your imagination here to make an interesting collage.
You will NOT be marked on your artistic flair, but you should
ensure that your demonstration does illustrate the functionality
that you have implemented.
You can use the images from the images directory provided with the project, or source your own, 
for example, from <a href="http://www.google.com/imghp">google images</a>.


<li> <b>CHALLENGE TASKS (optional)</b>
Completing steps 1, 2 and 3 (above) is worth 80% of the total 
marks for the project.
If you have time and wish to extend your knowledge of Java, then
you are encouraged to extend your project to take it
further towards a complete application. Up to 20% will be
awarded for the completion and demonstration of challenge tasks.
There are only a few project marks to be awarded for the 
Challenge tasks (relative to the effort required): 
this part of the project is primarily intended for interest and fun.

<p>It is up to you to identify, select and implement challenge tasks.
Submit a TEXT file, Challenge.txt, giving a brief summary 
of your challenge code: what you have implemented and how it works.
Some possible additions could be new ways of manipulating collages
or additional functions for manipulating images.
You may add new classes to the project, or add new methods to
given classes, but you must NOT change the signatures 
for any of given methods in the original project. 
As well as submitting the written summary, ensure that your 
MyDemo class shows the capabilities  of your challenge code. 


<p>If you are completing the challenge tasks, then to learn more about 2D graphics in Java try the 
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/2d/images/">Java tutorials</a>
For using colours in Java 
see the colorinfo guide on the Resources section of the 
unit web pages (and included in the project directory)
or search for online tutorials or see the text book.
</ol>

<p>SELF CHECK:  Your project will be marked  by running it with the classes that were distributed with the project.  
You must ensure that your submitted code runs with these classes.
These restrictions are imposed because object-oriented applications in Java 
rely on interactions between existing and new classes.
Therefore, learning how to work with given class interfaces is an important part of learning to use Java effectively.
   

<h3>Submission</h3>

Submit the following files to cssubmit by the PROJECT DEADLINE given in cssubmit.
Note that you must submit your code at the end of the week before the demonstrations.
It is allowed to make further changes to your code before the demonstration, but your submitted code will be marked for the other components.
<ol>
<li>Collage.java
<li>MyDemo.java

<p>If you have completed any challenge tasks, then also submit

<li>The .java files for any additional classes you have implemented 
or classes you have modified
<li>A TEXT file, Challenge.txt, giving a brief summary of your
challenge code: what you have implemented and how it works.
</ol>


<p><b>Remember that the published versions</b> of SampleDemo, CollageTest, Fragment and Canvas will be used to test your project.

<p>Marks will be deducted for project files submitted after
the deadline, or if files are submitted incorrectly and
a resubmission is needed.    35 out of 50 marks will be awarded for the code submitted to cssubmit by the deadline.

<p>If you wish, you may continue working on your code after it is submitted up to your demonstration.  15 out of 50 marks are awarded for the demonstration.

<p>In accordance with the departmental policy on plagiarism, 
all submitted lab work is expected to be the sole effort of the 
student submitting the work.
All submissions will be checked for similarity and the
consequences for misconduct can be severe, 
including being awarded 0 marks for assessment or
exclusion from the unit.

<p><b>Project demonstrations (15 minutes) will be held during 
normal lab times in Week 8 (April 14 to 17)</b> as published on the cits1001 schedule web page.
During the demonstration you will be asked to 
run your MyDemo, 
to answer questions about your code, 
and make modifications to your code.

<p>The tutors will have sign up sheets to book a demonstration
the labs from week 6.  You must sign up for a session and attend 
your demonstration at the correct time to qualify for the 15 marks. 
It will not be possible to hold your demonstrations outside your 
booked time, except in exceptional extenuating circumstances 
which must be reported through the correct Faculty channels.
Students who miss their demonstration will be awarded 0 marks
for this part of the assessment.  

<h3>Assessment Criteria</h3>

This project will be marked out of 50 using the following criteria:

<h4>Correctness (/20) </h4>
(Have all methods in Collage.java been implemented? 
Do they work as specified by the provided JUnit tests
in the CollageTest class?  
)

<h4>Style (/5)  </h4>
(Is the code clearly laid out with correct indentation
and good choice of variable names?  Have good choices been
made for programming constructs and patterns ?
Is every class, method and field commented as it should be ?
Have the author and version tags been completed in your classes ?)
 

<h4>Demonstration (/15)  </h4>
(Does the MyDemo class run and successfully illustrate the
correctness of your code? 
Can you explain your Java code 
and make minor changes to it ? )

<h4>Challenge Tasks (/10) </h4>
(Assess the quality and quantity of the code written for the 
challenge task.  Does the Challenge.txt file contain a clear
summary of what has been done and how?)
