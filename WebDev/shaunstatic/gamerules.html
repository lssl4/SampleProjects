		This is a diagram of the game. It consists of a UPS facility where you have to drop items into their appropriate conveyor belt (Smalls, Irregs or Cubic) from the cargo container at the bottom of the screen by dragging the packages that spawn from it. There is a timer and scoreboard to gauge how many packages you can sort properly under one minute. When you correctly place a parcel into the correct conveyor belt, you are award one point. Whereas, if you sort a package in the wrong place, you are awarded zero points.
