	<p>One of the core areas of UPS efficiency is the way how packages how stored in specialized cargo containers that caterred to different type of parcels and their surroundings (Gizmodo.com 2016). These containers are designed so that they can fit inside a plane as well as being handled by a human more efficiently (HowStuffWorks 2006). Here's a video below that showcase how large these cargo containers really is.</p>

<p>As you can see from the video, the cargo containers contain packages that are packed using as much space as they can. After these cargo containers arrive at their destination for sorting, these packages have to be sorted based on their shapes on the conveyor belt. Although most sorting is done using software now, here is a game that shows the work that goes into sorting these packages as if it is done manually</p>

<h1>How Global Courier Services Are Processed</h1> 

<article>
	<h4>It all begins</h4>
	<p>Global courier services get a reputation of fast deliveries to almost anywhere in the world. They boast how they can transport anything in under 48 hours different transportation modes such as road, air or rail (UPS 2012). It all begins with a delivery pickup and ends with a dutiful courier driver dropping off your package. Using UPS as an example, we can showcase how global courier services are processed and appreciate the work that goes into delivering a parcel. </p>

	<h4>Barcodes, Barcodes, everywhere</h4>
	<p>To get a feel how massive a global courier service like UPS is, they ship around 14 million packages daily and the amount of work to route packages takes some serious route management (UPS 2012). The key thing that makes their services run efficiently is the sorting method that UPS or any other global courier service use (HowStuffWorks 2006). These sorts depend on the bar codes that are sticked onto the shipping box applied either by the sender or a UPS employee (HowStuffWorks 2006). These barcodes help the sender and UPS track the package to view its journey. When your packages are finally labelled, they are tranported to a sorting center. These centers sort the parcels base on their distance requirements where they would be further transported via air or truck (HowStuffWorks 2006). </p>

	<h4>Efficiency of Global Courier Services</h4>
	<p>The efficiency of global courier services can be seen with the fact that they have specific airlines that just cater to their deliveries. They even have domed cargo containers filled with packages that fit against the curvature of the airplanes to reduce space wastage (HowStuffWorks 2006). UPS, in particular, also have their floors and airport concourses covered with ball bearings so that the UPS employees can move the cargo containers with ease (HowStuffWorks 2006). Long distance packages that are loaded into planes are further tranported to the UPS Worldport in Louisville, Kentucky. This is where the sorting begins every night for 1.6 million packages (Gizmodo.com 2016). The packages are separated based on their shapes on the conveyor belt and are moved around by rubber levers called hockey pucks (HowStuffWorks 2006). When the packages are finally sorted into their respective locations and size, they are flown to their destinations for their regional sorting process (HowStuffWorks 2006). </p>

	<h4>Just Before Delivery</h4>
	<p>The regional sorting facility is usually the last stop for packages just before delivery. The arriving packages are scanned again to print a pre-load assist label, or PAL. This label states how the UPS workers are going to place the boxes into which conveyor belt to the package car (HowStuffWorks 2006). It also states how the packages are going to place inside the UPS truck down to which area to which shelf of the truck it needs to be placed (HowStuffWorks 2006). This helps the UPS drivers to find the packages easily in the truck when delivering your packages so less time is used to finding the packages and more time is used to make more deliveries. </p>

	<h4>Delivery Time</h4>
	<p>The efficiency does not just stop at sorting packages. The UPS driver follows the routes determined by software to help him save gas when delivering parcels (HowStuffWorks 2006). Once the driver arrives at the receiver destination, he uses a delivery information acquisition device (DIAD) to scan the package one last time and allowing the receiver to sign for the delivery to indicate that the package has indeed been sent (HowStuffWorks 2006). </p>
